###Child's Motivation Chart (Game)
####Background: 
Children thrive with a consistent reward system, when  parents can clearly communicate their expectations to the child, and the child understands the rules. We've used a custom, paper-based "motivation chart" for our son for some time, and it's an excellent behaviour checker. As he completes his assigned tasks with good behavior, he progresses towards the end of the chart, where there's a big reward. When he performs poorly, he moves backwards (or loses lives, whatever). The paper version works fine, but it's not portable, and could be more entertaining for the child to interact with (using the tool could be a reward in itself). 

####Vision: 
Transfer the 2D, fridge mounted, game-board based tracking system into an interactive version hosted on the web. 

####Features: 
- Persistent saving of game state across all devices (mobile, PC). 
- Custom environment and avatar the child can choose to to play in, and with. 
- Environment includes: 
    - A path to progress along
    - Fun props (trees, water, characters, animals, sky, etc). 
- Parents can add icons (or tokens, images, etc) that clearly show the child "all the things" they can do to progress forward (children easily forget what they "can" do).
    - Parents are good at reminding their children what they _can't_ do, but rarely remind them what they _can_ do. 
    - It's the difference between fear of punishment to keep in line, or being empowered by motivation, to keep far away from the line.
- Gameplay elements: 
    - When a reward is earned, the avatar will move towards the end of the path. 
    - When a reward is lost, or a consequence for bad behaviour handed-out, the avatar will move backwards along the path. 
- A custom icon to represent the prize at the end of the game, or the _pot of gold at the end of the rainbow_. This will be different for every child

####Nice to have: 
Customized backgrounds can be uploaded (as images). 
All game props can be exported and printed (individually), so parents can use a paper version, if that's more convenient. 
Fun side games for the children to play, as their avatar, if they receive a reward: 
    - simple endless runner, or coin-collector
    - scene painter, to customize their environment further. 

###Crowd-Sourced Concept Development
####Background
Creative individuals, whether artists, 3D modelers, game designers, photographers, or coders, start projects because of a moment of inspiration, but quickly abandon them for lack of interest, discouragement from a technical challenge, or insufficient time to continue. 

####Vision
Instead of trashing these projects, or leaving them collecting dust, they can be uploaded to a website for other people to view. Other users can pick up those ideas, and:  
 - provide encouraing feedback to the original creator to continue the work
 - provide technical asistance to overcome technical barriers
 - take charge of the idea, and continue the project themselves
 - branch the idea into somethinng entirely different. 
 
 It's more than tech support. It's more like a repository for creative ideas, many of which will inspire other ideas. 
 The point is, we rarely complete ideas on our own. It's possible that the role of an individual in the creative process is to create the seed, or spark, and it's the job of the community to see that idea to completion. 
 
 ####Features: 
 - Upload any kind of electronic content (code, images, 3D models, games, photography, written word). 
 - Upload the seed to the community
 - As an idea is matured, snapshots are uploaded to the _timeline_ or _life_ of the idea. 
 - Show historical relationships between ideas (start, branches, contributors)
 - Analytics back-end, showing what role uses fill the most (some are seed plants, others are groomers, others just provide tech support, others are finishers)
 - Over time, pair complementary users with each other (starts with finishers). 
 - Determine rights of usage and licensing with ideas
 - Make a private version of the site, to facilitate collaboration between specific teams or individuals (some ideas may need an NDA?). 
 
 ####Nice To Have
 - The best coaches, who earn the highest peer ratings (star system?) can solicit their services for a fee (mentoring, one-on-one). 
 - They'll have a historical portfolio of contributions to their peers, and 

###Geographic Operations Visualization Tool
####Background
At my day job, we have many technical professionals with great, but complicated, technical concepts that they struggle communicating to customers, or each other. We have some artists or technical pros who can help them translate their vision into a functional prototype (image, movie, interactive app), but those projects are always one-offs, and code or assets are rarely re-used. The result, is concept development remains a slow, expensive process. 

####Vision
Create a suite of reusable assets, like a game editor, that laypeople can use to piece together concepts. Every project we finish will contribute code and assets to the suite, so we don't duplicate effort. 

####Features
- Simple, clean, easy to use UI that empowers non-tech savvy employees to simply build virtual concepts or environments.
